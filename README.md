## Assignment1: Efficient Interpolation using Cubic Bezier and Tomas Algorithm
This repository contains a solution for an efficient interpolation task. The objective was to develop a function, Assignment1.interpolate(), that performs interpolation of a given function f within a specified range using a specific number of points. The goal was to achieve accurate interpolation while optimizing for efficiency.

The implemented solution utilizes the Cubic Bezier method and Tomas Algorithm. These techniques allow for effective interpolation, enabling accurate estimates of values between data points. The focus was on finding a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.
